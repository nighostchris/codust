Task
Given an array of integers, Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product.

Notes
Array / List will contain positives only.
Array / List will always have even size.

Input >> Output Examples

```bash
minSum({5,4,2,3}) ==> return (22)
```

Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product, 5*2 + 3*4 = 22

```bash
minSum({12,6,10,26,3,24}) ==> return (342)
```

Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product, 26*3 + 24*6 + 12*10 = 342

```bash
minSum({9,2,8,7,5,4,0,6}) ==> return (74)
```

Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product, 9*0 + 8*2 + 7*4 + 6*5 = 74
